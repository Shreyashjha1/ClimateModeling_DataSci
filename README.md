This repository, ClimateModeling_DataSci, was created by Shreyash Jha (shreyashjha943@gmail.com) during an internship at Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd. It contains datasets, scripts, and tools for climate modeling and data science, focusing on analyzing environmental data to uncover patterns and trends through data science techniques.

Large datasets exceeding 100MB are managed using Git Large File Storage (LFS) for efficient version control. The project serves as a foundation for climate data analysis, providing resources for processing, visualization, and modeling to support further research in climate science.
