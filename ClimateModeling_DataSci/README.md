I completed my Project on "Climate Change Modeling " during internship under Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd.
Climate Change Modeling Project

This project, undertaken during my internship at Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd., focuses on modeling climate change to analyze environmental trends and predict future impacts. By leveraging historical climate data and computational techniques, the project aims to provide valuable insights into the factors driving climate change and their potential consequences. Key features include data analysis, scenario simulations, and visualizations to support informed decision-making for mitigation strategies.

Developed by Shreyash Jha (shreyashjha943@gmail.com), the project utilizes Python with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data processing and visualization. The repository includes scripts to run simulations and generate outputs, with detailed documentation for ease of use. For inquiries or collaboration, feel free to contact me at shreyashjha943@gmail.com. Special thanks to Unified Mentor Pvt. Ltd. for their guidance and support throughout this internship.
